            p(class=`${pStyles}`) I am a full-stack web developer, graphic designer, professional aquarist and hobbyist woodworker. I am currently living in Irvine, CA. I earned my degree in Political Science from UC Riverside and then signed up with AmeriCorps to begin an illustrious career in politics.

            p(class=`${pStyles}`) Spoiler Alert: I am no longer working in politics

            p(class=`${pStyles}`) Turns out, I am much more of a creative than a politician. It wasn't all a loss, though; during my time in national service I discovered a knack for graphic design. So after completing my tour I decided I would make a go at being a professional artist. After a short misadventure working as a fishmonger I landed a steady gig as a graphic designer at a live theatre. Suddenly, I was living the dream! I was being paid to be creative, and I even got free show tickets!

          .aboutContent(class=`${contentStyles1}`)
            p(class=`${pStyles}`) Like many people, I was suddenly without a job. After thinking hard about what I wanted from my career, I decided to attend the UCI Full Stack Flex Bootcamp. As a web developer I've found that my design sensibilities, love for creation, and passion-driven work ethic have given me a great excitement in this field.
