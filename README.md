Installation
-----------------------------

To install this application you will need a text editor like Visual Studio Code. There are several NPM packages which need to install with "npm install" in your CLI. These include barba, express, gsap, path, tailwindcss, and pug. You will also need to install or configure the Tailwindcss framework (https://tailwindcss.com/), PUG HTML compiler (https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), and Sass CSS compiler (https://sass-lang.com/).


Features
-----------------------------
This site was developed with Tailwindcss, Pug and Sass. Barba and GSAP were used for the animations. This site incorporates flexbox to create a responsive layout. Items that would normally display in multiple columns should display as a single column on smaller screens.

Other features include:
<ul>
  <li>Navbar links to navigate between content pages</li>
  <li>Page render animations to enhance the UX</li>
  <li>Brief biography and picture of me</li>
  <li>Portfolio page that contains technical projects with animated gifs and links to deployed apps and Github repos</li>
  <li>Functional contact page with Google Form that saves form content, as well as social media buttons</li>
